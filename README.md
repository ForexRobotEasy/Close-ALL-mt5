## Key Features

- Close all orders: The `CloseAllOrders()` function allows traders to close all open orders with a single function call. It iterates through all open orders and closes them using the appropriate bid or ask price.

- Close orders based on filter: The `CloseByFilter()` function enables traders to close orders based on a specific filter. In this code example, the filter is set to close orders for the 'EURUSD' symbol. Traders can modify the filter to suit their own trading needs.

- Custom panel class: The `CCustomPanel` class provides a framework for creating a custom panel user interface. Traders can define the panel's name, position, and button labels. The panel can be used to trigger the closing of orders by calling the appropriate functions when the buttons are clicked.

## How It Works

1. Initialization: The `OnInit()` function is called when the expert advisor is initialized. In this function, a custom panel is created and registered with event handlers for button clicks and panel movement.

2. Closing Orders: The `CloseAllOrders()` function is called to close all open orders. It iterates through the open orders using the `OrdersTotal()` function and closes each order using the `OrderClose()` function.

3. Closing Orders by Filter: The `CloseByFilter()` function is called to close orders based on a specific filter. In this code example, orders for the 'EURUSD' symbol are closed. Traders can modify the filter condition to suit their own trading needs.

4. Custom Panel: The `CCustomPanel` class handles button clicks and panel movement. The `OnButtonClick()` function is called when a button is clicked, and the appropriate order closing function is called based on the button clicked. The `OnPanelMove()` function is called when the panel is moved, updating the panel's position.

5. Main Loop: The `OnStart()` function is called to start the expert advisor. In this function, the custom panel is drawn, and the main loop is entered. The main loop continues until the expert advisor is stopped.
